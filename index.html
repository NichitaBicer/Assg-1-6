        <span class = "text" ><p class="tx">Once, there was a dog who wandered the streets<br>
            night and day in search of food. One day, he found<br>
            a big juicy bone, and he immediately grabbed it in<br>
            his mouth and took it home. On his way home, he<br>
            crossed a river and saw another dog with a bone in<br>
            its mouth. He wanted that bone for himself, too. But<br>
            as he opened his mouth, the bone he was biting fell<br>
            into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.
